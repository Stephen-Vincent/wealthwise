**Market Crash - {crash_date.strftime('%B %Y')}**

During this period, markets experienced significant volatility with {sentiment.lower()} investor sentiment. 
Market crashes typically result from a combination of economic uncertainty, investor fear, and external events 
that shake confidence in the financial system.

**Understanding Market Crashes:**
Market corrections of 20% or more happen roughly every 3-4 years, while severe crashes (40%+) occur about 
once per decade. These events, while unsettling, are normal parts of market cycles.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Market volatility is the price investors pay for higher long-term returns
2. Time in the market is more important than timing the market
3. Regular investing during downturns can actually improve long-term outcomes
4. Staying disciplined during crashes is crucial for investment success

Remember: Every major market crash in history has eventually been followed by recovery and new market highs.
