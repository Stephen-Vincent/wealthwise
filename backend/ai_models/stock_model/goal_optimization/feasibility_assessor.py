Goal Feasibility Assessment Module

This module provides honest, realistic assessment of whether users' financial
goals are achievable given their risk tolerance and market realities. It helps
prevent unrealistic expectations and provides actionable recommendations.

Key Features:
1. Reality Check Analysis - Compare goals against market realities
2. Risk-Return Alignment - Match required returns with risk tolerance
3. Adjustment Recommendations - Specific suggestions for improvement
4. Probability Analysis - Monte Carlo simulations for success probability
5. Alternative Scenarios - Modified goals that are more achievable

    Goal Feasibility Assessment System
    
    This class provides realistic assessment of whether users' financial goals
    are achievable. It compares what return the user NEEDS vs what return their
    risk tolerance can typically PROVIDE, then gives honest feedback and suggestions.
    
    Core Innovation: Many financial apps let users set unrealistic goals
    (like wanting 15% returns with conservative risk). This system provides
    honest reality checks and specific suggestions for improvement.
