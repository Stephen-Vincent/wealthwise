🚀 WealthWise – AI-Powered Investment Planning

WealthWise is an AI-powered platform that helps users plan and understand their investments. It creates personalised portfolios based on goals, timelines, and risk preferences, while also explaining the reasoning behind each recommendation.

Unlike traditional robo-advisors, WealthWise is designed as both a planning tool and a learning experience. Users don’t just see what to invest in—they also learn why.
